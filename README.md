**Reinforcement Learning to create the Connect Four Game with RL agents vs Humans**  
Simulate a real-life Connect Four game experience of a human player vs RL agents
The algorithm uses reinforcement learning to guide agents in a battle v.s. humans

***Agents Used***
1. Minimax Algorithm (Game Theory Guided Agent)
2. Monte Carlo Algorithm (Reinforcement Learning Guided Agent)
3. Q Learner Algorithm (Reinforcement Learning Guided Agent)
4. Sarsa Learner Algorithm (Reinforcement Learning Guided Agent)  

***The project*** 
compares and contrasts the performance of reinforcement learning guided computer agents on win-rate  and efficiency (average play time)
